## To run this app, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. Here are the steps to get started:

- Install Node.js and npm: You can download and install Node.js and npm from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. After installation, you can check the installed version by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
 ```bash
node -v
npm -v
````

- Create a new React app: You can create a new React app using the Create React App tool, which comes with a pre-configured development environment with tools and libraries. To create a new app, run the following command:
 ```bash
npx create-react-app my-portfolio
```

Replace "my-portfolio" with your desired app name. This command will create a new directory with the same name and set up all the necessary files and dependencies for you.

- Copy the files: Copy the files that I provided earlier (App.js, App.css, index.js, App.test.js, and serviceWorker.js) to the src directory of your new app.

- Run the app: To run the app, navigate to the app directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
 ```bash
npm start
````
This command will start a development server and open the app in your default web browser.

- Customize the app: You can customize the app by editing the App.js and App.css files. You can add your own content, change the layout, and customize the styles to match your preferences.
